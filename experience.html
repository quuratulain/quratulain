<br>
<p>When I was 7 years old, I have my first wound stiches. It was because my fault that</p>
<p>I want to follow the other kids across the big drain at our school.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my skirt is too tight untill it brings me banged on the street corner</p>
<p>Untill now, the scar is still on my forehead</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>The most unforgettable experience for me is when my friends and I finished to memorize Juzuk 1 Al-Quran.</p>
<p>To appreciate our efforts, our school held the program "Majlis Pensijilan Tahfiz Al-Barakah"</p>
<p>I remember that time we so happy to receive the certificate from school.</p>
<p>Memorizing Al-Quran makes me realize that we have to read Al-Quran enthusiastically and carefully to avoid any errors.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<p>It was always a dream of mine, and one shared by millions of other Muslims, to go perform Hajj and Umrah at Mecca.</p>
<p>Mecca is a holy place of Muslims in Saudi Arabia where it is believed that the prophet Muhammad lived and taught more than 1,300 years ago.</p>
<p> Mecca is the holiest city in Islam. There are billions of people coming to Mecca for Hajj from all over the world.</p>
<p>I hope one day that I wil become one of the billions too. I want to look with my eyes about how beautiful Mecca is. </p>
