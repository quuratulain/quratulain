  <h1>NASI KERABU</h1>
  <p>Nasi Kerabu is my top 1 favourite dish. It's just *chefkiss*.From the state of Kelantan in northen peninsular Malaysia, nasi kerabu gets its eye-grabbing color from telang flowers, which are crushed and mixed into flour.
  The aquamarine dish is topped with bean sprouts and fried coconut, then drenched in spicy budu, a fermented fish sauce. Usually, it also coming with salted eggs. 
  In true Kelantan style, you use your hands to dig into this one. Nasi Kerabu is truly amazing!

  <br>
  <div>
  <h1> CHICKEN CHOP</h1>
  <p> I also very love to enjoy Chicken Chop. My first encounter with Western food is the chicken chop.The chicken chop is a piece of de-boned chicken thigh, breaded and deep-fried or just plain grilled or pan-fried. 
   Its accompanying sauces are usually black pepper or mushroom which you pour all over the chicken. 
   The usual side dishes that come with the chicken chop are the coleslaw and French fries.
   Thus, fulfilling the requirement of meat + carbs + greens.
   I ACTUALLY Really, Really, Really <b>LOVE</b> Chicken Chop! ðŸ˜€

  <div>
  <h1>APAM BALIK</h1>
  <p> You are not Malaysian if you don't ever eat Apam Balik.Apam Balik mostly selled at night market.It is also one of street food
     that I love so much. A pancake-style snack wedded with the compact package of an omelet, apam balik is stuffed with more than a sufficient amount of sugar, peanuts and the occasional sprinkle of corn.
	 Basically, it's a dish that's constantly being reivented and it is yummy.

  <br>
  <div>
  <h1>ROTI JALA</h1>
  <p> In fasting month, Ramadan. I always buy Roti Jala to eat when we break fasting.It is delicious and amazing.
      Roti  jala, or net bread, gets its name from the net-like formation that's created by making zigzagging lines with flour on a large skillet.
	  The final product is folded up like a crepe and usually served with chicken curry.

  <div>
  <h1>POTATO TWISTER</h1>
  <p> Twister Potatoes also called Tornado Potatoes,Tornado Fries,Spiral or Twoster Fries are a really popular street food,originally developed
  in South Korea. These are whole potatoes,that are spiral cut and put on a skewer before they are deep fried. They are seasoned with many variations and 
  some variations even have sausage in between.Whenever I go to the night market, i usually buy it and share with my siblings.

 <img src= "foodrink/gp.jpg" alt="Pisang Goreng" style="width:30%;">
  <br>
  <div>
  <h1>PISANG GORENG</h1>
  <p> The popular Malay snack of goreng pisang (banana fritters) is one of those dishes that has variations in banana-growing countries around the world.
  The deep-frying helps caramelize the natural sugars in the bananas, making them even sweeter than they were to begin with.
  Usually, my family and I having Pisang Goreng in tea time while chatting with each other.

  <br>
  <div>
  <h1>COCONUT SHAKE</h1>
  <p> Hot weather in Malaysia will make you feel thirsty, so that Coconut Shake probably will help you deal with it.
  Coconut Shake, an absolute tropical delight to taste buds, is prepared by blending toasted coconut,milk and ice cream and sweetened with sugar to taste.
  It will always my top favourite drinks and i can't never get over of it.

   <img src= "foodrink/gt.jpg" alt="Green Tea" style="width:30%;">
  <br>
  <div>
  <h1>Green tea</h1>
  <p> I choose green tea as one of my favourite drinks because it contains many benefits.
  Studies suggest that consuming green tea may positively affect skin health, help with weight loss, and reduce the risk 
  of cardiovascular disease.Green tea is ne of the healthiest beverages and the best food source of a group called â€˜Catechinsâ€™
  So, I enjoy drinking green tea without hesitation.
